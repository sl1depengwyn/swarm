--   fine-grained analysis where we differentiate between the

--   (since e.g. an unused let-binding would still incur the
--   capabilities to *evaluate* it), which does not seem worth it at

    -- conservative if the lambda is never applied, but such a

    -- lambda). We also don't do anything with the argument: we
    -- assume that it is used at least once within the body, and the
